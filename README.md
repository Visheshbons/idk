## Chapter One

Thüsh lies on a mat of thatch, her iridescent blue patches shimmering softly. Her body is illuminated by the pale red light shining through the window, rolling over her like lazy clouds. The sound of clanging metal on metal outside makes the ground jolt slightly—the coppersmiths have already started work for today. The air had a tinge of sweetness, the scent drifting from an acacia in the distance, blending with the odour of mildew from last night’s mist. Thüsh’s delicate, pastel purple fur ripples like a sheet of satin as she stands, revealing a weary, bored face. ‘I guess I should write something this morning…’ she flashes to herself. Rolling out of bed, she attempts to shove her blanket off, only ensnaring herself further, swiping helplessly at the fabric. It wraps around her torso smugly, and she swipes with her soft paw in rebellious annoyance, before slipping out, finally free of her sleepy bonds, leaving the blanket sulking on the floor. Her ears perk up as something crashes onto the dusty floor—her writing rod, she realises after closer examination. She places the warming copper rod in the flame, then pours a fresh batch of rosin into the mould, letting it cool and harden. Holding the handle with her gossamer forefeet, she begins carving, the smoke rising in long, dark ribbons. 

>*I have always felt different. My lights have never been like my family’s. They’ve always had a different glow. I’m the only one in the village that really cares about writing. It’s the one thing I’m good at.*

*This is boring*, she thinks. *Why do I even do this? Oh p̈ang, I’m leaving for the city today.*
‘Thüsh! You need to get ready!’ her sut shouts, frantically waving at the clock. Thüsh rolls her eyes and starts gathering her belongings. *Let’s see… what do I need?* Her floor, covered with an assortment of random objects, makes it impossible to find anything useful. She snatches at her tanned leather harness and fills the pouches. A quartz crystal, a leather canteen, her crossbow, anything that could be of use. She hurriedly shuffles towards the door, her harness awkwardly strapped, and then realises. Her writing tools! She straps a pot of orange-yellow rosin to her thigh for later, and hooks the rod onto her flint. *I’m ready*, she realised, her flickering lights sending waves across her body, while a burst of euphoric energy rolls over her as her metallic blood fills with oxygen. *What will it be like in the city?* she wonders, daydreaming about rivers full of sparkling Nechou scales and towering glass skyscrapers and—
‘Thüsh, it’s time for you to receive your knife,’ her kaẗ flashes softly, interrupting her thoughts. She unhooks the dagger off her belt, the copper’s orange glisten intensified by the red glow of the sun. As her kaẗ passes it into her trembling paws, Thüsh is immediately snapped out of her ignorant, dozy state, entranced by the blade, all else forgotten. She notices the rose quartz at the crossbar—the most striking detail. She rubs it timidly, feeling its edges, watching the way the light glimmers as it passes through it, converted from soft, dim red to a rich, vibrant lavender. The copper looks even more dazzling up close, its oxidising metal outlining the edge in a subtle seafoam green. ‘Where… where did you get this?’ she flashed, her lights stuttering, her body almost shaking. ‘It’s beautiful’. 
‘I made it,’ her gaẗ said, coming into view from behind the doorframe. ‘The quartz can channel your light. Try it’. Thüsh hesitantly caused the patch on her paw to glow, intense and powerful, leaving Thüsh’s mind hazy from the lack of oxygen. Sure enough, a purple aura appeared throughout the blade, and smoke drifted up from inside. ‘Wow…’ she blinked, shocked. ‘Thank you, Gaẗ!’ she shouted with glee, rushing in for a hug, before realising she is still holding a red-hot blade. Carefully dipping it in a nearby trough to cool it, she slid it into a leather sheath on her right foreleg, before cuddling all of her parents in one giant, furry, squishy pile. The atmosphere hummed with a strange cocktail of love, fur, skin oils, and ozone as they embraced, Thüsh unexpectedly overwhelmed by the mix of sensations. The brilliance from the three nechous’ unadulterated joy blinded the humans, who covered their eyes but continued the embrace. Thüsh’s tail swishes side-to-side, spraying dew-coated grass on her parents. ‘I love you all so much,’ she glowed nervously. ‘How will I survive out there without you all?’
‘Thüsh, you’ve never really needed us,’ her zut beams, unusually confident, her curled blue fur strikingly outlined against the sun. ‘You’ve always been smarter than all of us combined. Now go out there and show the world. They’ve been waiting for you’. Thüsh blazes with pride, unable to contain it, her light blinding her parents. ‘Th-thank you’, she tries to flash, her light stuttering. ‘I won’t let you down’. She turns to stroll towards the village gates, but stumbles, trying to snatch one last glance at her parents. Turning away, not wanting them to see her tears, she leaves her home—her only home, ever—behind. 

As she wanders down the village streets, the hot red sunlight breaking through the pale cloud cover, her mind begins to bubble. *I never really fit in here anyway. They’re all coppersmiths and woodworkers, not artists, writers, or academics. No one in Ramṫ even knows how to write—other than me, I guess.
Will there be others like me in the city?
Why would someone ever bind to me?*
And, strongest of all, 
*Who really am I?*
The thoughts rub against her brain like the stones against her paws. 

She just reaches the central square when she notices a fishmonger snickering. ‘P̈ȧ'ngüm,’ he hisses as she walks past. *Neverbinder*. The word sat in her chest as he laughs at her faded lights and downturned expression. ‘You’ll never be a Whole!’ he shouts, amused, chucking a rancid fish head at her, which landed with a wet slap on the cobbles. The square fell silent. She can hear her blood rushing through her, faster and faster, panicking. Her head begins to pulse. The other villagers look away as Thüsh passes, gossiping in hushed voices. The sun’s red glare seems to intensify. *Just ignore him,* she tries to tell herself. *He would hate you no matter what.* She can’t bring herself to believe it. The head—lifeless, cold—oozes juices into the cobbles, its pungent stench rubbing against the back of her nose, clinging to it. The air crackles with ozone, amplified by the tense bystanders. Overwhelmed, her lights start to flicker erratically. She feels faint. The world feels unstable. He continues laughing, clearly entertained by her distress. This is fun to him. This is sadistic to her. *I… I need to go* she frantically thinks, trying to calm herself down. The flashes begin to ease as she distances herself from the square. *You’re okay, Thüsh, you’re okay,* she tries to reassure herself, to no avail. *Why do you have to be so sensitive? Most people wouldn’t even care*. The blood on her paws drips onto the cobbles, but it doesn’t matter. It’s time to leave.

Still recovering from the confrontation, she decides to gather a few more supplies from the local market, far from the square. She notices a worn-down leatherworker’s hut tucked away in an alley. *Perfect* she thinks. *I don’t have that many coins left*. Inside, an ancient nechou sat, slumped over a workbench covered in copper tools. Her fur—once a vibrant scarlet, it seemed—is now a pale sunlight red, patchy and fraying at the tips. Her eyes look melancholic and dreamy, as if she is returning to a long-lost childhood, if only in her mind, and her patches twinkle in a soft, warm orange. ‘Hello?’ Thüsh blinks nervously, unsure whether she should wake her. Her azure light bounces off the nechou’s glassy eyes, and a human—just as frail and elderly—appears from behind a shelf. She brushes softly at her Half’s fur, tucking it behind her ears. 
‘She’s just tired’ the woman whispered. ‘She is as old as me, but we don’t get much light in here’. 
‘Oh…’ Thüsh glances at the sleeping nechou again, empathetic. ‘I… I was just wondering if you have any paw covers?’ she asks gently, holding up her paw, caked in black, metallic nechou blood. 
‘Of course… what did you say your name is?’
‘Thüsh. Oh, can I also get… um… I need some crossbow bolts and a sundial. No, I’m being silly. You won’t have those…’
‘Well, Thüsh. No one has come in here for days, so I’ll give you a discounted rate on all of that. And yes, we have some sundials and bolts in the back. I’ll just get them out for you’.
As she leaves, the nechou begins to stir. 
‘Jan? Is that you?’ she glows, looking slightly startled.
‘Ummm… my name’s Thüsh. And you are…?’
‘I… I can’t remember…’
The human appears from around the corner again, holding some copper bolts, a small sundial, and a strange black box.
‘We can’t remember our names,’ she said, nostalgia clouding her eyes. ‘We forgot them long ago… Anyway, that will be 10 copper coins, please,’ she states matter-of-factly, snapping out of her trance. ‘And I have this for you too—a bit of hematite for the trip. No extra cost’.
‘Thank you,’ Thüsh says warmly. 
‘We wish you well on your journey, young one’, she says, smiling knowingly.
‘Wait… but I never said—’
‘Oh darling, we have our ways of knowing,’ she remarks slyly as Thüsh leaves the store. *It’s finally time to go* she thinks. *No more stalling*. The door to the shop creaked shut, and she glances at the Whole through the pane. *They’re so happy together*, she reminisces. *I hope I can have that*.

She walks towards the outer walls, feeling the weight of the sundial on her back hip, the bolts in her quiver, and the box of hematite bouncing against her forearm. Before stepping out, she looks back on her village. It’s where she grew up, but is it really hers? It feels like a distant dream already. Somewhere that never really existed. She glances around at all the things she took for granted. At the fountain she used to play under. At the leathersmith that crafted her harness. At the shrine to a god long forgotten, yet still visited every day up until now. Her past. The good, the bad, the horrific. She tosses one last worn copper coin in—her sut’s. He said it would be important one day. *Oh please, god-that-has-no-name, bring me good fortune—and hematite—for the journey ahead.* Thüsh knows she won’t be back here for a very, very long time.
